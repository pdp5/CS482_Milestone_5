We have created an UI which allows user to type in a random word into the search box and once the user click on submit button, it returns the video related to the user's input. We have created two pages; one where 
the user can type in the word, and the other one will display the video which related to the user's input. We have tried hosting our website, but when we visit the url it gives us the 404 error and it displays the 
error saying that index.html file is missing, but we have already pushed the index.html file. Hence, we are attaching a few pictures below to show how my UI is working. The first image is taken after submitting war 
word as an input.
